# chacha-customized-photoooth
A cute, online photo booth website built with vanilla JS, HTML5 and CSS, inspired by photo strips hanging on my dorm room. Features webcam capture, high-res strip downloads, and 2 custom frames I designed myself using ProCreate, and an adorable toggleable Pink/Blue theme system to match your aesthetics!
